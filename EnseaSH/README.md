# EnseaSH

## Synthesys Pratical Work 1 : Ensea in the Shell

**Objectives**: Develop a tiny shell, that displays exit codes and execution times of launched
programs.

- [x] Q1: Display a welcome message, followed by a simple prompt (everything is in a single file, refactoring in next questions)
- [x] Q2: Execution of the entered command and return to the prompt (REPL: read–eval–print
loop)
- [x] Q3: Management of the shell output with the command "exit" or with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>
- [x] Q4: Display the return code (or signal) of the previous command in the prompt
- [x] Q5: Measurement of the command execution time using the call clock_gettime()
- [ ] Q6: Execution of a complex command (with arguments)
- [ ] Q7: Management of redirections to **stdin** and **stdout** with '<' and '>'
- [ ] Q8: Management of pipe redirection with '|'
- [ ] Q9: Return to the prompt immediately with '&' (execution of programs in the background)
